# VampireSurvivorsLike
Welcome to my portfolio project! This game is a personal challenge to build something fun while sticking closely to SOLID principles and proven design patterns.
Right now, I’m modeling the game after Vampire Survivors, since this is my first time working in this genre. What it becomes in the end? That’s something only time—and development—will tell.
It's still a work in progress, but you can try the playable demo below. Feedback is welcome!
